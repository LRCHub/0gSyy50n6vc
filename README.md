A fresh wash of sunlight
Spreads over the grass and windowpanes
When the last wisp of smoke dissolves in the lake
As if nothing has changed
Those black and white turn into colors on
Every piece of petal now softly gleaming
Found myself whispering your name as one touched my skin
I see time finally shed its chains
Flying free like a paper plane
In this common start of day
This is the world you fought for
All things unfold and extend in order as they did before
This is the spark you have guarded
With both your hands and all your strength
Through nightmares to the break of dawn
The frozen pulse of life
Now beats again
The breeze is singing your faith
Across the vibrant plain
When the mortality
Echoed between you and the abyss
Like a twisted and crescendo finale
Not once did you ever flinch
You chose the alternative narrative
Stare at the tragedy, raising your voice
Sing the lament out loud like a battle song
On the way to starting point
I see spring profusely waking green
Along the paper plane's trace
In this common start of day
This is the world you fought for
All things unfold and extend in order as they did before
This is the spark you have guarded
With both your hands and all your strength
Through nightmares to the break of dawn
The frozen pulse of life
Now beats again
The breeze is singing your faith
Across the vibrant plain
Paper planes are flying faraway
Wish they could fly across the space
Gently land on your palm and tell you
This is the world you fought for
All things unfold and extend in order as they did before
This is the spark you have guarded
With both your hands and all your strength
Through nightmares to the break of dawn
(Hopes) The frozen pulse of life
Now beats again
The breeze is singing your faith
Across the vibrant plain
