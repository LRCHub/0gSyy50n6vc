[00:11.80] A fresh wash of sunlight
[00:13.85] Spreads over the grass and windowpanes
[00:16.63] When the last wisp of smoke dissolves in the lake
[00:20.79] As if nothing has changed
[00:22.84] Those black and white turn into colors on
[00:25.40] Every piece of petal now softly gleaming
[00:28.34] Found myself whispering your name as one touched my skin
[00:33.53] I see time finally shed its chains
[00:37.94] Flying free like a paper plane
[00:41.11] In this common start of day
[00:44.55] This is the world you fought for
[00:49.05] All things unfold and extend in order as they did before
[00:55.55] This is the spark you have guarded
[01:00.09] With both your hands and all your strength
[01:03.13] Through nightmares to the brеak of dawn
[01:08.37] The frozen pulse of lifе
[01:14.45] Now beats again
[01:19.34] The breeze is singing your faith
[01:25.22] Across the vibrant plain
[01:31.76] When the mortality
[01:33.89] Echoes between you and the abyss
[01:36.67] Like a twisted and crescendo finale
[01:40.73] Not once did you ever flinch
[01:42.78] You chose the alternative narrative
[01:45.31] Stare at the tragedy, raising your voice
[01:48.25] Sing the lament out loud like a battle song
[01:50.70] On the way to starting point
[01:53.56] I see spring profusely waking green
[01:58.00] Along the paper plane's trace
[02:01.14] In this common start of day
[02:04.55] This is the world you fought for
[02:09.02] All things unfold and extend in order as they did before
[02:15.59] This is the spark you have guarded
[02:20.09] With both your hands and all your strength
[02:23.13] Through nightmares to the break of dawn
[02:28.32] The frozen pulse of life
[02:34.47] Now beats again
[02:39.35] The breeze is singing your faith
[02:45.15] Across the vibrant plain
[02:48.70] Paper planes are flying far away
[02:53.19] Wish they could fly across the space
[02:56.13] Gently land on your palm and tell you
[02:59.74] This is the world you fought for
[03:04.23] All things unfold and extend in order as they did before
[03:10.72] This is the spark you have guarded
[03:15.20] With both your hands and all your strength
[03:18.33] Through nightmares to the break of dawn
[03:21.76] (Hopes) the frozen pulse of life (bloom)
[03:29.64] Now beats again (in)
[03:34.55] The breeze is singing your faith (your dream)
[03:40.28] Across the vibrant plain
